# SimpleTodo
The SimpleTodo app is a todo app for Android. It is simple, free and open source. 

I decided to make this app because I wanted to practice creating REST APIs with the [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/). Additionally, I wanted to get more familiar with OAuth2.0 authentication so I decided to implement the [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/authorization-code-flow-with-proof-key-for-code-exchange-pkce). Below is a summary of the tech stack used for this project:
| System            | Technologies Used |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Andoid App        | Kotlin, Coroutines, Koin, Retrofit, MVVM, Single Activity Multi Fragment|
| Authentication    | Auth0 SDK (Android & Scala), OAuth2.0, JWT|
| Backend Service   | Scala, Play Framework, Slick|
| Database          | Postgres, PSQL|

I decided to open source this project because I imagine there are some other Android developers out there who are interested in learning more about backend. If that's you, then this repo (and the [backend repo](https://github.com/MackHartley/SimpleTodoService)) would be a good guide to learn how to make your own backend service.
